Ingredients
===========
* Anko
    - Adzuki Beans
    - Equal Parts Sugar (+/- according to taste)
    - 1/2 t Salt per 1 C Beans


Instructions
============

1. Soak beans in large pot for 14 hours
2. Drain beans and refill until covered by 1-2 inches of water
3. Bring to a rolling boil
4. Once boiling, discard water + refill to 1-2 inches covered
5. Bring to a medium low simmer for 1-1.5 Hours (may need to increase time depending on volume of beans)
6. When the beans are soft and easily mashable, drain over sieve and return to pot
7. At low heat, add the sugar and mash those puppies!  Keep in constant motion
8. Once everything is incorporated, add the salt!
9. Done when viscous enough to draw a clear cut line through the bottom


Notes
=====
* Have salt ready to throw in!
* Adding more beans seriously increases the boil time, be wary
* Note you may need to add more water during the simmer to avoid burning the beans
* Also good to give the simmering bois a stir every once in a while
* The finished paste will thicken a bit once you're done, so be careful not to overcook!
